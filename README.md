K-WatchManager is a very simple CLI application to record data and calculate the deviation of your watch collection.
You can register the following data of your watches:
- Brand.
- Model, REF number...
- Caliber.
- Type of caliber (Quartz, automatic, mechanic...).
- Theoretic deviation.
- Last adjustment.

You can record a watch adjustment, and come days later to check the accuracy of the watch, It tells you the total deviation and the approximate everyday deviation.
